The "Guess Star" game mode allows you to test your knowledge of K-pop stars."\n"
         Guess the names of K-pop artists from photos. It\'s not important for you to know what group the star on screen is in, but it is important to know his or her name. You have 3 lives. The correct answer will increase your score, and the wrong answer will take lives. "\n"
         In addition, for every 35 points, 1 life will be restored to you, and for every 70 a hint will be added. But I think you\'ll figure it out."\n"
         Good luck :)

The "Guess Band" game mode allows you to test your knowledge of the most famous K-pop groups in history!
         Guess the group the artist is in on the screen. Every correct answer increases your score! And the unfaithful reduces life. It is clear that when lives end, the game will be over."\n"
         In addition, you have 3 hints for the game, which will tell you the letters that make up the name of the k-pop group. Every 35th group guessed will restore one life to you. And every 70th will add a hint. But I think you\'ll figure it out."\n"
         Good luck ;)

The "Distribute by bands" game mode allows you to test your knowledge of k-pop groups"\n"
        You are given a set of different K-pop stars, and you need to divide them into 2 groups. To distribute artist cards, you need to swipe them to the side of the screen corresponding to the K-pop group. "\n"
        At any time you can view all artist cards and redistribute them. After you confirm your distribution, you will be shown whether everything is distributed correctly, after which you will move on to the next pair of groups. "\n"
        Every time you are wrong by more than one artist, one of your lives is burned. As soon as everything is over, the game will end. For each pair of correctly distributed artists, you will receive 1 point. So try to answer correctly!
        Well, there are also hints - they will show the names of the artists, so that it would be easier for you to understand what group they are from."\n"
        Lives are restored every 50 points, and hints are restored every 100 points. "\n"
        In reality, everything is much simpler - good luck!"\n"
        Distribute them all ãƒ„
