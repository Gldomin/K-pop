        Guess the names of K-pop artists from their photos. It doesn\'t matter which group the star belongs to on the screen, but it\'s important to know his or her name. You have 3 lives. Correct answers will increase your score, and incorrect ones will take away lives. "\n"
        Additionally, for every 35 points, you will get 1 life, and for every 70 points, a hint will be added. But I think you\'ll figure it out."\n"

        Additionally, you have 3 hints per game, which will show you the letters that make up the name of the K-pop group. Every 35th guessed group will restore one life to you. And every 70th will add a hint. But I think you\'ll figure it out."\n"

        The "Group Sorting" game mode allows you to test your knowledge of K-pop groups"\n"
        You are given a set of various K-pop stars, and you need to distribute them into 2 groups. To distribute artist cards, you need to swipe them to the corresponding K-pop group on the screen. "\n"
        After distribution, you can view all artist cards and redistribute them. After confirming your distribution, you will see if everything is distributed correctly, after which you will move on to the next pair of groups. "\n"
        Every time you make a mistake of more than one artist, one of your lives will be lost. Once all lives are gone, the game will end. You will receive 1 point for every correctly distributed pair of artists. So try to answer correctly!
        Also, there are hints - they will show the names of the artists to make it easier for you to understand which group they belong to."\n"
        Lives are restored every 50 points, and hints - every 100 points. "\n"
        In reality, it\'s all much easier - good luck!"\n"
